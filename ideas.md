## Capture and Replay ##

 Capture and Replay is a web-based network traffic capture and replay tool made using django and scapy powered by python. This tool can be used to upload, edit and play trace files inside live networks. You can refer to the documentation here.

Goal: To create an environment to replay the suspended malicious packet and to analyze the threat in Capture and Replay
 
Skill Level: Advanced  
Language/Tools: Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
Tags: Networking, Web Development, Malicious software  
Mentors: Dr.Deepamala, Dr.Shobha

## Data Skew Profiler ##

This project analyzes the execution graphs for various jobs and finds a correlation between the data skew and performance skew in HPCC Systems/Clusters.

Goals:
- Upload data into the distributed environment using a database by creating clusters.
- Design a ML algorithm to work on the distributed database(implement algorithm and get result) and check with benchmark result.

Skill Level: Advanced   
Language/Tools:ECL, Python

Mentors: Prof.Jyoti , Dr.Shobha  

## Recommender System using Machine Learning in RVCE Connect ##

RVCE Connect is an Android app that allows RVCE students to view their Attendance, Test Scores, Timetable etc.

Goals:
- Connect alumni of RVCE(over 10000 people) with its current students for internship opportunities abroad.
- Create a Machine Learning model that suggests the Alumni for a specific research project/job completion based on the feature input given(Recommender System)

Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced

Mentors: Dr.Vinay, Prof.Jyoti

## WIFI support in ‘Intelligent Maze Solver’ ##

Intelligent Maze Solver was developed by an RVCE Team during an IIT Kharagpur Competition-Pixelation in 2018. This project intelligently guides a robot wirelessly through a maze using an overhead camera. The student must have access to a webcam and an ESP8266 module(preferably NodeMCU 1.0). 

Goals:
- Smart maze detection with Deep Learning using overhead camera and write state of the art algorithms for maze traversal(with time complexity better than O(log n).
- Use Wi-Fi for wireless communications(using NodeMCU 1.0 ) rather than XBee/HC-05 Bluetooth Modules.
- Writing an API for NodeMCU in python for effective interface

Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate  
Language/Tools: Python, Arduino Programming

## Write Code for WiNoC in BookSim2 network simulator ##

BookSIm 2.0 is a cycle-accurate interconnection Network Simulator for Network on Chip Architectures,developed at Stanford. It generates synthetic traffic and is extensively being used by researchers.
The student must have a basic knowledge of Computer Architecture( Network on Chip Architecture in particular)

Goal: The goal is to write well-documented code for the proposed ‘Wireless Network on Chip’[WiNoC], and various other routing algorithms that are not already present in BookSIm 2.0.

## Implementation of Odd-Even Routing of NoC on FPGA ##

Network on Chip Architecture is the word of tongue these days in Processor Architectures. You can find more about NoC here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_on_a_chip . Our goal is to implement the famous odd-even routing on hardware(FPGA). 

Prerequisites:
- Computer Architecture
- NoC Architecture
- Knowledge to use BookSim 2.0 Network Simulator
- FPGA Programming(verilog, VHDL or even MyHDL)
- Xilinx Vivado

Skill Level: Advanced  
Language/Tools: Verilog, VHDL  
Tags: FPGA Programming, XIlinx Vivado  
Mentors: Prof.Namita, Dr.Minal  

## Port Verilog Code to MyHDL ##

Writing code in verilog/VHDL seems tedious and non-friendly for beginners. On the other hand, Python is gaining a lot of popularity amongst beginners. MyHDL is a beginner-friendly Python Library that can be used as an alternative to Verilog and other HDLs.
Our aim is to rewrite our existing verilog code in python.
You can refer to our already existing code here: ----------------------------------------.

Prerequisites:
- Verilog/VHDL
- Python
- Basic Computer Architecture

Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced   
Language/Tools:Verilog, VHDL, Python  
Tags: Hardware/FPGA Programming, MyHDL  
Mentors: Prof.Namita, Dr.Minal  

## Aruco Marker Project ##

Aruco Markers are a special class of markers used in pose estimation, which is of great importance in many computer vision applications: robot navigation, augmented reality, and many more. This project aims to create a website that will determine the pose using aruco markers, thereby speeding up of aruco marker testing for augmented reality with Unity 3D.
You can learn more about Aruco Markers here: https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html
